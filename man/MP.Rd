\arguments{
\item{group}{which group (defined by period first treated) an group-time average treatment effect is for}

\item{t}{which time period a group-time average treatment effect is for}

\item{att}{the group-average treatment effect for group \code{group} and time
period \code{t}}

\item{V_analytical}{Analytical estimator for the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix for group-time average treatment effects}

\item{se}{standard errors for group-time average treatment effects. If bootstrap is set to TRUE, this provides bootstrap-based se.}

\item{c}{simultaneous critical value if one is obtaining simultaneous confidence
bands. Otherwise it reports the critical value based on pointwise normal
approximation.}

\item{inffunc}{the influence function for estimating group-time average treatment effects}

\item{n}{the number of unique cross-sectional units (unique values of idname)}

\item{W}{the Wald statistic for pre-testing the common trends assumption}

\item{Wpval}{the p-value of the Wald statistic for pre-testing the
common trends assumption}

\item{aggte}{an aggregate treatment effects object}

\item{alp}{the significance level, default is 0.05}

\item{DIDparams}{a \code{\link{DIDparams}} object.  A way to optionally return the parameters
of the call to \code{\link[=att_gt]{att_gt()}} or \code{\link[=conditional_did_pretest]{conditional_did_pretest()}}.}

\item{ddml_weights, ddml_mspe}{When ddml estimation used stacking, returns the
stacking weights and corresponding mean-square prediction errors of each
learner for every group and time period.}

\item{reduced_forms}{When ddml estimation was used, returns the out-of-sample
reduced form predictions for every group and time period. Note that the
reduced forms for doubly-robust ATT estimation are \eqn{E[Y|D=0, X]},
\eqn{E[D|X]}, and \eqn{E[D]}. The \code{reduced_forms} object can also be
populated by the user-specified est_method by returning a list element of
the same name.}
